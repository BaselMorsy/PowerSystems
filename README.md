# PowerSystems
A computational package developed in Julia language for power systems. The package is for research and educational purposes.

## Capabilities:
1. Solving OPF (AC and DC)
2. Solving OTS (AC and DC)

## Usage:
1. Run `config.jl` to install requirements.
2. Run `main.jl` to run an example 5 bus power system
3. There are other standard systems that can be found in [here](./Systems)
